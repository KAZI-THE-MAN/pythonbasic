World War I or the First World War(28 July 1914 â€“ 11 November 1918),often abbreviated as WWI,was one of the deadliest global conflicts in history.
It was fought between two coalitions, the Allies and the Central Powers.
Fighting took place throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia, especially East Asia.
An estimated 9 million soldiers were killed in combat, plus another 23 million wounded, while 5 million civilians died as a result of military action, hunger, and disease. Millions more died as a result of genocide, while the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was exacerbated by the movement of combatants during the war.
